# Heart Disease Prediction with Logistic Regression

## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on predicting the presence of heart disease using **Logistic Regression** based on clinical and demographic features. The analysis includes data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, evaluation, and interpretation of results.

The study demonstrates how classical machine learning methods can be applied to healthcare datasets to support early risk assessment and decision-making.
